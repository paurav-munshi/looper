# Looper
## Intorduction
The Looper project is a event loop utility which could be used as an underlying mechanism for developing additional user-friendly libraries or frameworks. Though it cab be used directly by applications to leverage different flavours of event loop implementations, its highly suitable to provide a backbone for developing other framework or utilities which would be used by application teams. 

The Looper is mainly inspired from various projects or platforms like Netty and Node. But additionally it also tries to provide a framework which is distributed and scalable by default. This is because it provides a distributed implementation of the event loop where a program can emit and even and that event can be handled by the same JVM, another JVM on same machine ot a different JVM on a different on a different machine all togather.
